# Problem Statement
**Title:** Enhancing Product Insights and Customer Experience in Retail through Data Modeling and NLP

#### Background: 
In the competitive retail market, understanding customer feedback and optimizing product offerings are crucial for driving sales and customer satisfaction. This workshop will demonstrate how to build a basic end-to-end data modeling pipeline using a retail dataset. The dataset consists of various electronic products, including details such as product names, prices, ratings, and user reviews.

#### Objective: 
The goal is to analyze product reviews to extract valuable insights using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We will demonstrate how to preprocess the data, create a simple predictive model, and derive actionable insights from customer sentiments.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset contains the following columns:

```
product_id: Unique identifier for each product.
product_name: Name of the product.
category: Category of the product.
discounted_price: Current discounted price.
actual_price: Original price.
discount_percentage: Percentage of discount.
rating: Average rating given by customers.
rating_count: Number of ratings received.
about_product: Description and features of the product.
user_id: Unique identifier for users who provided reviews.
user_name: Names of users who provided reviews.
review_id: Unique identifier for each review.
review_title: Title of the review.
review_content: Main content of the review.
img_link: Link to an image of the product.
product_link: Link to the product page.
```

# End-to-End Solution Outline


**Data Exploration**
- Load the dataset.
- Examine the structure and contents of the data.
- Identify any missing or inconsistent data.

**Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values.
- Translate non-English reviews to English (if applicable).
- Normalize and clean text data (e.g., removing special characters, lowercasing).

**Sentiment Analysis**
- Use an NLP library (e.g., TextBlob, transformers) to perform sentiment analysis on the review_content column.
- Categorize reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
Visualization
- Create visualizations to show the distribution of sentiments and their relationship with product ratings and prices.

**Modeling**
- Build a simple machine learning model to predict product ratings based on review content and other features using a neural network (e.g., Keras).

**Insights and Conclusion**
- Summarize key findings and actionable insights derived from the analysis.
